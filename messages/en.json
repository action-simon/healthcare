This ensures that the care received matches the patient's personal preferences, even if they are unable to make decisions for themselves. In this, there is collaboration between professionals to achieve the best care outcomes within this palliative phase within this target population.",

Due to improved diagnostics and treatment, people are living longer. People are living at home longer and attention is being paid to the values, wishes and needs of patients and their loved ones. Their values, wishes and needs is what good palliative care is all about. We believe it is important that every citizen is assured of palliative care in the right place, at the right time and by the right caregivers. This is why we invest in optimizing palliative care in physical, psychological, social and spiritual areas.",
  "more_text_4": "What is palliative care?",
  "more_text_5": "Palliative care is care for patients and their loved ones dealing with a life-threatening condition or frailty. This care improves the quality of life by preventing and relieving suffering. Having an eye for problems of a physical, psychological, social and spiritual nature is central. Early detection and careful assessment and treatment of these problems is essential.

At ZonMw, we want to use knowledge and innovation to improve the quality of life for people with dementia and their loved ones.",
  "moretext2_2": "Types of dementia",
  "moretext2_3": "The most common types of dementia are Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia. In the diseases, nerve cells in the brain are damaged, causing them to function worse and process information less effectively. This affects memory, body and mental health.",
  "moretext2_4": "How does dementia occur?",
  "moretext2_5": "Much is unknown about the processes that lead to dementia. There is also often no 1 cause to point to. Therefore, we are funding research into the origin and mechanism of dementia. This includes further identifying and understanding how genes, nerve cells, glial cells and proteins work. Unraveling the mechanisms may also ultimately help treat, diagnose or prevent dementia.",
  "moretext2_6": "Better care, support and activities for people with dementia",
  "moretext2_7": "It is important that people with dementia and their loved ones are able to participate in our society and have a good quality of life. With the right care, support and activities, they stay active, healthy and socially engaged longer by staying in touch with others. We focus on care and support of people with dementia, through our research programs from the medical and social domain.",
  "moretext2_8": "When a person is diagnosed with dementia, the palliative phase begins. This phase lasts on average between 6 and 8 years. In order to know the wishes and needs of a person with dementia, it is important to have a timely conversation about this so that it can be established in a timely manner. The estimated last three months of life in the palliative phase is called the terminal phase. Good cooperation between professionals involved is important to ensure that the last phase of life runs as smoothly as possible.",
  "moretext2_9": "Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their loved ones dealing with a life-threatening condition by preventing and relieving suffering, through early detection and careful assessment and treatment of pain and other problems of a physical, psychosocial and spiritual nature.",
  "moretext2_10": "When the palliative phase begins, it is important to discuss wishes and needs about the last phase of life in a timely manner (advance care planning).",
  "moretext2_11": "On time in conversation",
  "moretext2_12": "Due to the long period of palliative care, most healthcare professionals find it difficult to start right away. Yet it is important as a professional to start the conversation about this in time. This is advance care planning, where you identify the wishes and needs of a person with dementia so you can provide better care.",
  "moretext2_13": "Wishes and needs",
  "moretext2_14": "Advance care planning is important in persons with dementia. When a person with dementia is in an advanced stage, they can no longer always articulate their wishes and needs. By starting the conversation early in the dementia process, people are even better able to express what they would like around the end of their lives. It also ensures that in acute situations what can be done is already decided, making the GP's job easier.",
  "moretext2_15": "An important part in palliative care is communication with the client. For palliative care, there are a number of topics you need to pay attention to. With these, you can contribute to the client's quality of life.",
  "moretext2_16": "Communication in palliative care is vital because it helps to understand and respect the needs, wishes and concerns of the patient and their families. Effective communication allows caregivers to put the patient at the center of the care process, support them in making decisions, manage their pain and symptoms and improve their quality of life. It also helps build trust and provide emotional support to the patient and their loved ones during this difficult time. In short, good communication contributes to a better palliative care experience for all involved.",
